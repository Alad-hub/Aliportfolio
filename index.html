  <h3>Introduction</h3>
  <p title="hi there">
    Hello ladies and gentlemen, notice how I said ladies first?<br>
    Today you'll be going through my Portfolio website.<br>
    Do excuse the lack of a more intuitive UI and creative depth, as I haven't worked with HTML and CSS in a while, to add to that this web's being created under strict time constraints.
  </p>

  <h3>Tutorial</h3>
  <p title="If you're reading this, that's awesome">
    There's not much to learn in terms of navigating the website, there should be a <b>Next</b> button on the bottom-right, and an additonal <b>Previous</b> button from the  next page onwards.<br>
    <small>Tip: hover your mouse over the paragraphs for hidden easter eggs.</small>
